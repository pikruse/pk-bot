# To-Do List
A list of features we still need to add

## 1. Music Player (In Progress)
* Make a working music player bot
* Joins vc on `/play`, has `/skip`, `/queue`, and `/stop` commands
* Make sure `/` commands appear in discord for autocompletion

## 2. Mailing List (Not Started)
* Make functions to send loops and beats out to discord mailing list on a command (e.g. `/send_loops`, `/send_beats`)
* DM users on list with link to dropbox. Link can be the arg
